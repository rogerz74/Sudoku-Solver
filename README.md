# Sudoku-Solver
Java Project for Hack the North

# Inspiration
We were reading a newspaper left on the sidewalk the other day and decided to look at the sudoku section. However, we found the newspaper sudoku problems to be way too challenging. So we decided to build a program that allows us to solve any sudoku puzzle.

# What it does
The user puts a select set of numbers into a 9 x 9 sudoku board. The program will then try to solve the sudoku using 5 different "strategies" or "solving methods". If the initial input by the user is faulty or if the user's input board does not contain any solutions, the program will not give an output.

# How we built it
My team used Java and the Swing GUI to create this solver.

# Challenges we ran into
It was definitely challenging for us to write the code for the 5 different "solving methods" that the program could use. It took us a huge amount of time to come up with these strategies and took us even more time to implement the code.

Furthermore, most of the team consisted of coders with limited coding experience. Hence, it was also hard to get started and come up with a project idea that was doable for everyone within the given time slot.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of ourselves for being able to finish this solver. Although the design and the overall aesthetic of our project isn't the best, we are still happy that it functioned in the end.

# What we learned
We learned that with a limited amount of programming experience, it can become challenging to bring big ideas to fruition. However, we also learned that through effective communication and teamwork, challenges can be mitigated and solved faster.

# What's next for Sudoku Solver
Futures steps for the Sudoku Solver would include including a sudoku generator that generates solvable sudoku boards for users to solve, improving the efficiency of the solving methods, and making a GUI screen that looks better than what we have currently.
